# Hi there, I'm Prajwal L K Urs  🌌

### In the vibrant heart of Bangalore, where code takes flight, A sophomore ascends, bathed in AI's radiant light. With clouds as my canvas, DevOps as my guide, and Android code flowing like a tide, I shape digital dreams where endless possibilities reside. A tech sorcerer in this silicon age, My mind is a forge, where the future takes the stage.
